# WatchTheClock
Interactive clock powered by ESP32 for Yale cpsc334

## Motivation

In Watch The Clock, the viewer sees how time can be upended. The project consists of an innocuous clock hanging on a wall. When a viewer stands in front of the clock it will appear to act normally, presenting the correct time. But when there is no one watching the hand of the clock swirl randomly or move in along specific paths. In the subjective experience of life, time twists and curves. Then why donâ€™t clocks act the same way? With Watch The Clock time becomes subjective. Immerse yourself in the strings of time, experiencing not linear time but personal time.
